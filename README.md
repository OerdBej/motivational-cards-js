# Motivational JavaScript Cards

Picture this - a fun little project I made to up my game with CSS and object-oriented programming in JavaScript. I call it motivational picture cards. It's a modular project that's simple, yet effective in helping me hone my skills. What it does is use CSS styling and transitions to make the pictures inside it change smoothly. But you know what else you can use this approach for? Testimonials! It's a versatile code that can be adapted for other projects too.
